Debugging examples

https://asu-compmethodsphysics-phy494.github.io/ASU-PHY494/2019/02/05/05_Debugging/

Copy the `bug_*.py` files to your workspace and fix them there:

    mkdir ~/PHY494/05_debugging
    cp bug_*.py ~/PHY494/05_debugging
    cd ~/PHY494/05_debugging

Solutions will be posted (in the solutions directory) before
the next class so that you can check what you did.
